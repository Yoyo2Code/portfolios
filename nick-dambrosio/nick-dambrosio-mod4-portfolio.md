**Action Step #1:** Establish a shareable calendar (like Google Calendar) and block out time on your calendar _now_ to adhere to these goals. Be prepared to show this calendar to your instructors during your portfolio review.

**Action Step #2:** Backwards plan for your big goal. What is your cut-off for ending the job search? When do you want to receive and sign an offer by?
Within the first thirty days, I'll make a decision of if I should attend the back-end program, or any other similar programs ( because it takes months for the VA to process anything ).

Mental evaluations of the process every monday (maybe a blog post).
Will be checking in with Kate early and often, and keep my job-group in the loop about my findings, challenges, and and victories

**Action Step #3:** Based on what you outlined above, create monthly, weekly, and daily goals to reach in order to reach your big goal:
Minimum daily goals:

- One personalized cover letter and one cold outreach / day
- 2-3 applications. not including one-tap-applies
- Finish Portfolio early, and pass it out to as many people as possible

Weekly goals:

- 50 commits
- 1 app
- 1 cold outreach meeting
- 5 Jobs with legitimate applications

Monthly goals:

- 3 offers
- 1 rejection

* What skills would you like to improve or develop?

- Learn SVGs and making complex animations with them
- Reach out and embrace freelance opportunities
- Finish portfolio, continuously approve it
- Mastering react

* Are there areas from Turing's program that you feel weaker in? How will you level up?

- Backend needs a lot of work, and mastering this will only help me as I go

* Are there new languages or technologies you'd like to learn? How and when will you do that?

- I'm going to continue to learn Vue, and then possibly check out Ember next

# Outreach and Networking

**Action Step:** Establish a “daily-practice” repository

- Daily Exercisms / Codewars

**Action Step #1:**

- Tom King (1804), has become a close friend and mentor through our time at Turing. we plan on hanging out multiple times per week and working on different things together. He's incredibly talented and pairing with him on anything will boost my skills immenseley.
- Paul Kim (1804), like Tom, has been an invaluable ally and friend at Turing. He's going through the Back-End program starting at 1901, so we'll try to collaporate on something using his new skills to help hone them even more.
- Kasra Rahjerdi - Pre-Turing software developer friend who works at Inscape has been a dev for over ten years and is interested to see new technologies that he hasn't necessarily had a chance to work with yet, but has a strong knowledge base that near anything he could share would be valuable

**Action Step #2:**

- React Meetup is one I'll go to whenever possible.
- Weekly Bootcampers Collective weekly JS meetup
- UX/UI meetings at GA Industry in RiNo

### Job/Company Research & Tracking

Success in the job search means staying organized. The best way to do that is to have a clear system to keep track of your contacts, research, and updates on what you're doing.

**Action Step:**
I have a spreadsheet to keep track of everything that I can share with Jeff, my job coach.

### Interview Prep

**Action Step:**
I plan on doing codewars and exercisms at least once a day. Solving problems I haven't already solved is sometimes a struggle for me, and takes longer than I would like, so I need to focus on this as I know this will be something I encounter in interviews

### Housekeeping

Make sure you have all your job search components up-to-date and looking their best!

**Action Step #1:**

Opening pitch could be worded better.

**Action Step #2:**
Holy moly do I despise LinkedIn ( or any social network really) but getting flooded with memes from recruiters is getting super dumb. I hope to delete the app once I get a job, but it's up-to-date for now

### Other

- Blogging
- Speaking at a meetup

**Action Step:**
I've been sitting on an empty medium account since I started Turing. I have serious plans to get this started once I finish Turing. Girlfriend and I have plans to make a podcast, too.

### Check-ins: Who are you talking to and when?

Jeff once a week, job-hunt group every few days.

**Action Step:**
I'll check in with Kayt, my buddy who went to Turing, and my mentor.

### Identifying & Overcoming Barriers

**Action Step:**
My personal barriers are laziness that come when I have a lot of things going on at once. I probably haven't been going as hard on the job search as I should have this mod, but I can say that's because I've been devoting so much mental energy to Turing and learning.  Now that I won't have a scheduled time to be somewhere for a majority of my day, I feel this barrier won't be too bad.

## #3: Post-Grad Plans & Action Steps

In this section, you'll find action steps that you should aim to complete during your first 30 days post-grad, but these are not steps that you need to have completed for your portfolio review. Instead, you should begin thinking about how you will achieve these steps, and your post-grad job search support coach will ask about progress on these during that first 30 days.

**Scheduling Post-Grad Action Step:** At the end of each week during your first 30 days, assess what worked with the schedule and what didn't so that you can make adjustments as needed and manage your time even more effectively for the following week. This will also help you keep a record of what you've done in your job search.

**Outreach Post-Grad Action Step:** During the first 30 days, you should aim to reach out to at least 10 individuals. Even if you don't have a list of all 10 for the draft of this plan for portfolio review, be prepared to meet this target during your first 30 days of the job search.

**Job/Company Research & Tracking Post-Grad Action Step:** Reach out to and apply to at least 10 companies/jobs.

**Housekeeping Post-Grad Action Step #1:** During this timeframe, you should establish a “master” resume that you’ll customize per employer. You should already have a working version that you submitted in Module 3.

**Housekeeping Post-Grad Action Step #2:** Establish a “master” cover letter with your key talking points that you'll customize per employer.
