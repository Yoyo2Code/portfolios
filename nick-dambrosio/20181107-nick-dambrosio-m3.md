## Individual Self-Assessment

A lot of really cool things clicked this mod. Unfortunately, at the same time, a lot of things didn't and caused more trouble than I'd like to admit. Thankfully, with a two week intermission between mods 3 and 4, I'll be able to redo lessons and projects and improve on existing code.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

### Personal Project

garnish: [Github](https://github.com/30ozSteak/garnish)
a trim of news for your morning. a curated news app that displays news based on user interaction in a simple/clean manner. Took too long to accomplish basic tasks and I paid the price for it in lack of sleep. Thankfully, when everything did start clicking, it made the rest of the project flow pretty easily, and solidify parts of redux that I didn't fully grasp coming in.

## C: Group Work & Projects

SWAPIbox:
[Deployed](https://swapi-box.netlify.com/)
[Github](https://github.com/30ozSteak/SWAPI-Box)
[Assessment](https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1806/mod-3/swapi/laura-nick/scores.md)
[Trello](https://trello.com/invite/b/JwdSQBnf/6b520820b8713e57d34451e8c5154a06/movie-tracker-fam)
swapibox felt like the biggest deep dive into react component architecture since starting turing, and it felt really good. I pulled off some really amazing things with swapibox, and some easter eggs no one has seen yet are layered into the code. Fun times

MovieTracker:

MovieTracker was rough. The majority of 1806 was struck with the flu during the weekend before swapi-box was due/ the week that movietracker was assigned, and this encouraged my group to pick responsibilities and tasks, and communicate via slack / video chat as we coded from home. Didn't work as well as we had planned, but at least I got to learn SASS and start getting my feet wet with router

## D: Community Participation

I participated in an Iron FE, but _more importantly_, _THREE TIME TOP TALK NICK HERE WE GO_.
