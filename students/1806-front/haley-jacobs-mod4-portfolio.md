Action Step #1: [My Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/r/week/2019/1/14?sf=true)

Action Step #2: Backwards plan for your big goal. What is your cut-off for ending the job search? When do you want to receive and sign an offer by?

I would like to have a job offer by March 30, 2019. I don't know when I will cut off my job search, potentially by next July if it is continuously unsuccessful. 

Action Step #3: 

## Daily, Weekly, and Monthly Goals

### Daily Goals

* Exercise for an hour everyday
* Eat healthy
* 1-2 hours of code lessons
* 1 hour of refactoring old projects
* Make commits to GitHub

### Weekly Goals

* Mock Interview
* 1-2 Coffee Meetings
* Cold outreach to one person at a company
* Checkin with Brittany

### Monthly Goals

* Get to the second round of 3 interviews
* Have most projects refactored with CSS Preprocessor
* Finish one of the two online lessons I have purchased 

What is feasible in your schedule?

I can devote most of my time to job search and furthering my coding skills, refactoring old projects, and helping students in lower mod with their projects.

What actions will give you the most impact in your search?

* More Cold Outreach and coffee meetings
* Mastering code challenges and technical interviews.

### Coding

What skills would you like to improve or develop?

I want to improve some of my abilities with CSS preprocessors such as Sass by refactoring old projects. I also am interested in improving my skills creating endpoints, Express, SQL, and creating database tables. I might try to do the project BYOB myself after graduation.

Are there areas from Turing's program that you feel weaker in? How will you level up?

I feel weak in some styling areas. I plan to restudy some CSS and get better and faster at implementing good design.

Are there new languages or technologies you'd like to learn? How and when will you do that?

I plan to expand my knowledge in React, GraphQL, and JavaScript Algorithms. I have purchased two online coding courses: the Fullstack Advanced React and GraphQL from Wes Bos and the Udemy course JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Masterclass which I plan to start shortly after graduation (within the next few weeks).

Action Step: Establish a “daily-practice” repo:

[Daily Practice](https://github.com/hljacobs5/daily_practice): In this repo I will work on small code challenges and make sure my github has commits everyday. I will use it for morning code challenges I find on LeetCode, Exercism, or CodeWars as well as lessons given to me in online tutorials.


### Outreach & Networking

Action Step #1: Identify at least 3 individuals from companies you're tracking who could connect with during your first 30 days. Describe why you want to connect with these people and what you hope to talk about, when you will email them by, and what your follow-up will look like once you've met with them.
* Individual 1: 

  Company: Trineo
  
  Name: Brett Kana
  
  Why: Interested in a position at the company they work for I feel I am qualified for. [Job Post](https://www.builtincolorado.com/job/engineer/software-engineer/43518)
  
  When: I will email them by next Friday.
  
  Follow-up:  Depending on if they can meet with me, I will send them a thank you email that I will draft and send to my job      coach and others to proof read.
  
* Individual 2:

  Company: The Trade Desk
  
  Name: Still looking
  
  Why: Interested in a position at the company they work for I feel I am qualified for. The company has good reviews and was named one of the  top 20 places to work by Glassdoor. [Job Post](https://www.thetradedesk.com/careers/position?gh_jid=1482372)
  
  When: Again, after graduation will try to draft a message for them and send it by next Friday.
  
  Follow-up: Depending on if they can meet with me, I will send them a thank you email that I will draft and send to my job      coach and others to proof read.
  
* Individual 3:

  Company: NewMedia
  
  Name: Looking for contact info
  
  Why: Company looks great, completely based around UI designs. Would be wonderful to learn more about the company and the available position. [Job Post](https://newmediadenver.com/about/careers/?p=job%2FojnA2fw2)
  
  When: Send email by January 20.
  
  Follow-up: Depending on if they can meet with me, I will send them a thank you email that I will draft and send to my job      coach and others to proof read.
  
Action Step #2: Find Meetups

* Meetup 1: [React Denver](https://www.meetup.com/ReactDenver/events/kgrmmqyzcbtb/): React Denver is often held at Turing School which I am very familiar with. I'm also mostly interested in working with React for my first job as a junior dev.

* Meetup 2: [Denver Mock Programming Job Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Denver-Mock-Programming-Job-Meetup/events/vrjsnqyzcbcc/): I don't know much about this group, but the description of the meetup seems that they are starting a new session of week sprints in coding projects. It could help me keep up my git commits and coding skills.  
      
* Meetup 3: [Women Who Code Boulder/Denver](https://www.meetup.com/Women-Who-Code-Boulder-Denver/events/xqfbmqyzcbwb/) - It would be a good way to connect with other women in the technology field. The meetups seem to vary from teach lessons to happy hours, a variety of activities with a (relatively) regular group of people to talk about code could be beneficial.

### Job/Company Research & Tracking

Action Step: [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/SA27KVrD/job-search) 

### Interview Prep

* Area 1: Practicing style and grace in technical interviews when I do not know the answer. I plan to schedule mock interviews with Turing alumni, practice with friends and cohort mates. I enjoyed my technical mock interview with Austin Wood and plan to schedule another one by January 20 at the latest.

* Area 2: Further mastering code terminology by reviewing old lessons and giving myself a refresher on some things learned in previous mods.

* Area 3: Master telling my professional story and my motivation to become a software developer by practicing mock questions given to me by my job coach.

### Housekeeping

Action Step #1: Turing Portfolio up to date: [My Portfolio](https://alumni.turing.io/alumni/haley-jacobs)

Action Step #2: Updated LinkedIn.

* Added skills learned during my time at Turing.
* Updated my LinkedIn description to show I'm studying front end development.
* Added Turing School to the list of my education.
* Once I feel proficient in a new framework I will add it to my skills.

Blogging - I would like to publish an article about coding on a blog site. I know many Turing grads have published articles on sites such a Medium, I have yet to think of a topic but after I graduate I will take sometime to brainstorm.

Planning and submitting meetup and/or conference talks - Public speaking is a fear of mine that I want to get better at. Therefore, I will try to push myself to collaborate with meetup leaders and find a good subject that I feel passionate about to speak about at their meetups.

### Check-ins: Who are you talking to and when?

Action Step: Identify 1-2 people you'll check in with during your first 30 days post-grad. 

I plan to check in with Allison, Brittany (my job coach), my mentor, and a family member who attended Turing.

Identifying & Overcoming Barrier:

Action Step: Identify 1-2 "barriers" you might put on yourself in this job search as well as the steps you will take to overcome them. Be prepared to describe these in your M4 portfolio review.

* I have a tendency to procastinate but I am trying really hard to overcome that. I think the calendar schedule will be particularly helpful for me.
* I get nervous about cold outreach and messaging people. I plan to send my email drafts to one of the four people mentioned above for feedback and to help calm my nerves.

#3: Post-Grad Plans & Action Steps
In this section, you'll find action steps that you should aim to complete during your first 30 days post-grad, but these are not steps that you need to have completed for your portfolio review. Instead, you should begin thinking about how you will achieve these steps, and your post-grad job search support coach will ask about progress on these during that first 30 days.

Scheduling Post-Grad Action Step: At the end of each week during your first 30 days, assess what worked with the schedule and what didn't so that you can make adjustments as needed and manage your time even more effectively for the following week. This will also help you keep a record of what you've done in your job search.

Outreach Post-Grad Action Step: During the first 30 days, you should aim to reach out to at least 10 individuals. Even if you don't have a list of all 10 for the draft of this plan for portfolio review, be prepared to meet this target during your first 30 days of the job search.

Job/Company Research & Tracking Post-Grad Action Step: Reach out to and apply to at least 10 companies/jobs.

Housekeeping Post-Grad Action Step #1: During this timeframe, you should establish a “master” resume that you’ll customize per employer. You should already have a working version that you submitted in Module 3.

Housekeeping Post-Grad Action Step #2: Establish a “master” cover letter with your key talking points that you'll customize per employer.
