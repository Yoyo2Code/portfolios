## A: End of Module Assessment

Passed

## B: Individual Work & Projects


### SwapiBox

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/marcusp619/swapibox)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html)

### Passed
In this project I really had to learn not to be married to your code. There were multiple times where I had to scrap large parts of my code, and basically restart over because of forseen problems later on down the road. I also had the the privilege to do this project by myself, and I felt very confident at the end of the project with what I had completed. This set me up with much needed confidence moving forward in module.

#### Specification Adherence
2 - The application is in a usable state, but is missing some of the features outlined in the specification above.

#### Code Quality
3 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

#### CSS/Design
4 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has minimal recommendations for design changes. Follows 10 Essential Usability Guidelines.
React Router
1: Application did not use a Router

#### Testing
3 - Almost all components are tested to a level that indicates developer has an understanding of testing

#### Wireframes
Pass - Developer team laid out their thinking using wireframes before building their project

#### PropType Implementation
Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.

#### README Updates
Pass - The README.md file has been updated with a description of the project, the team, and how to get it up and running

#### Code Sanitation
The output from ESLint shows…
1 - More than ten complaints

#### Workflow
4 - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that clearly document the evolution of the application and do not contain irrelevant changesets that aren't reflected by the commit message. Commit messages are concise and consistent in syntax and tense. Developer(s) are using a rebase workflow, effectively use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing directly to master. There are no instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There are no instances of "dead" or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log.


### Binary Challenge

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/marcusp619/vintage-comic-trading)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/binary-challenge.html)

### Passed
In this project we were given an Api and audience with a week to come up with a unique application. I loved the challenge of the project, this project showed the growth from mod2 through mod3, and I was proud of my growth. I also challenged myself to use TDD this project, something I had struggled with throughout the mod. I also learn that it’s really important to thoroughly prep before you start coding. This is especially true when doing TDD, if not you will have refactor multiple files. 

#### Specification Adherence
3 - The application uses the above technologies to a professional level. The evaluator has minimal recommendations for refactoring or design changes.
10 Essential Usability Guidelines.

#### Project Professionalism
3 - PropType functionality is complete, the codebase has less than 5 linter errors, README has been updated with all group members. Project utilized wireframes from the outset. All git commits are atomic, made first to branches, and use descriptive and consise commit messages. Project demonstrates a fundamental understanding of React architecture.
#### Testing
3 - All Redux functionality is tested (actions, reducers, mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps), all components are unit tested, and a valid attempt was made to test any async functionality.
#### Redux Architecture
3 - Appropriate components are wrapped in connected Redux container components. The Redux store contains all necessary application data. All state changes are handled through Redux actions and reducers.
#### Routing
3 - Application uses React Router to display appropriate components based on URL.

Passed

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

t was a breathe of fresh air to work with strong developers like Dina an Alex. The confidence we had in each other made it a smooth and stress free environment to work in. I really learned how to Unit test from both of them. I also learned how to be better organized from Dina, and from Alex I learn how to break problems down in a different perspective.

#### Movie Tracker

## D: Community Participation
I made a solid effort to stop by Mod 1 and Mod 2 on a daily basis to check-in and to remind them that we are here to help. Doing so multiple times I was asked for help or just to let someone vent.

### Playing a Part
Along with Kevin we helped the intern with his personal website and taught him some HTML and CSS. I also provided him some resources I used to prep for Turing.
