# Kevin Simpson - M4 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My goals this modules were simple: My goal for Mod4 was to find a sense of comfort with the things that I've learned while at Turing while gaining at least a modicum of understanding of how to setup a back end and continuing to solidify my ability to use CSS. I feel like I accomplished both of these things. I feel like my abilty to write and test in React is very solid, my understanding of interacting with and consuming APIs is quite strong, and I have found my stride in turning design into reality.

## A: End of Module Assessment

Pass

## B: Individual Work & Projects

I felt quite comfortable with my solo projects during this mod. What I did not immediately understand, I was able to figure out with a little bit of research and rarely with asking for help.

#### (Palette Picker)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/relasine/pixel-picker)
* [Deployed Project](https://pixel-picker.herokuapp.com)
* [Project Specs](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/palette-picker.html)

This project was to build an Express server to support a modest application for creating and storing color palettes.

#### (Final Project)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/relasine/space-cats)
* [Deployed Application](https://space-cats-in-space.herokuapp.com/)
* [Project Specs](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/final-countdown.html)

- This project was to utilize the NASA Picture-of-the-Day API to build an application that serves up the NASA Picture of the Day and allow user to go back through the last month of pictures with the ability to, with one click, return to the current day. Unfortunately, the NASA POTD API is down, so I built my own API in express and used it to serve up the data. It's a single endpoint that takes a number as a single request parameter, with '0' being the current day, '1' being the day previous, etc.

- Nice pivot on setting up the back-end.

## C: Group Work & Projects

#### BYOB

* [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/relasine/Formula-1-API)

* [Project Specs](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/build-your-own-backend.html)

This project was to build a database using PostgreSQL and knex, to serve up the data with an Express server, and to write documentation for it so that it might be easily consumed.

* Nice job.

#### Pitch Battles

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/relasine/pitch-battles-frontend)

Pitch Battles is a desktop web application built in React that is designed as a training tool for musicians to practice and learn reading pitches on the staff. The Pitch Battles experience is entirely gamified using 90s-era 16-bit art assets, account tracking with personal performance evaluation and achievements, global leaderboards, and class-based comparison and tracking tools for music teachers to see how their students are doing. I worked incredibly hard on this project, and I am extremely proud of how it turned out.

It's real good!

A+

(feedback to me)
Using SASS/SCSS would have probably saved me a bit of time with vendor prefixes. 


## D: Community Participation

### Gear Up

While I have spent quite a bit of my life as a teacher, I have never had to lead a professional development session before, and I'm honestly glad that I had the opportunity. The concept of assertiveness is a complicated one, and I think discussing it in a focused and safe environment was really interesting to me, despite the fact that I was at peak mental and physical exhaustion at the time thanks to our cross-pollination. I only wish I would have had more time and energy to dedicate to it. 

### Playing a Part

My participation in the community was a bit less-involved than in previous mods, but I did go out of my way to as helpful as possible to my fellow students, particularly those in the earlier mods. I may not be a teacher by trade anymore, but I still really love doing it.

## E: Mod 5
