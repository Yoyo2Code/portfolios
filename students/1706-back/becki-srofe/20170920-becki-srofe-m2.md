# First Last - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

I wanted to have a solid understanding of the information that was presented in class and have confidence that I could make the things that I was expected to make. I also had a goal to meet people outside of Turing in trying to start making connections that could turn into job opportunities later. I think that I was mildly successful with that. I had a goal to go to one meetup a week and that definitely did not happen, but for the meetups that I did go to, I felt like I made some solid connections that could benefit me later. As far as the first goal, I do feel like in the end I got there, although I feel like I got off to a slow start.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

The biggest struggle I had was with the sheer amount of information and syntax that we had to learn. I had a hard time trying to figure out what was important to memorize and what was OK to look up. Mod 1 had a lot of feedback built in due to having multiple assessments and a project every week, and that gave me confidence. I struggled with not having that this mod. I think what I learned the most from that struggle is that it will all work out and that I probably need to ask for more feedback if I know that I need that or if I need help clarifying what is more important. I think I also learned that at some point I have to take some time out for myself even if I am feeling overwhelmed for the sake of my own mental well being. I didn't do that this mod and I think it just made me more stressed.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?

My favorite projects were job tracker and the mini project. I liked job tracker because it was the first thing we had to make that wasn't a tutorial so it gave me a lot of confidence that I had learned what I was supposed to have learned and that I could do what I needed to do. I liked the mini project because I got to use my own idea so I was much more motivated. I wish we would have had more time to work on it.

My least favorite project has been Little Shop. I think this is because we had to follow the cards in order so it was hard to split and have people working on different things. It was hard for four people to try and work on the same card and that led to what felt like a lot of wasted time. I also got really, really frustrated trying to make a gem work.

What did you learn from your independent projects?

I think the independent projects gave me the repetition that I needed to remember all the syntax and steps needed to crud an app. It helped me to learn how to read someone else's code since most of the tutorials started with code already written.

What did you learn from your paired projects?

I definitely learned a lot about git workflow. This did not really make sense to me in mod 1 and that was cemented during bike share. I think I also learned a lot about how to work on a project in a larger group in general, as opposed to a pair.

## Community

What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?

My favorite gear up was the one on Johari's Window. I had never heard of this before and found it really interesting. I can't say that I was really surprised by anything that was said or not said about me, but it was interesting to see what was said multiple times and what things that are important to me that maybe don't show up in this environment.  

My least favorite gear up was the last one on the agile manifesto. I think it was my least favorite because it almost seemed a little too late. We had learned about waterfall and agile in the beginning of the mod to help with bike share, and it was a little confusing to come back to it so much later. I also would have liked more examples of how real companies are using it.

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?

I paired with mod 1 students on serveral occasions. I joined the JCS and although I can't really say I contributed anything to it this mod, it is a goal moving forward. I also was a TA for a Try Turing event.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?

As mentioned above, I would like to be more involved with JCS and TA another Try Turing event. It is also the tradition in my posse for mod 3 students to lead the posse and since there is no mod 3 front end person in my posse I will be doing that.
