# First Last - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

Learn as much as I can while also bonding with my cohort mates and becoming a better developer. And yes I did. Although I think, at this point, I am repeating. I do think I was successful.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

I struggle to learn as quickly as a lot of other people so I have to put more time in to be at the same level as everyone else. But, I know that is just how I am and will continue to improve.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?

My favorite project was Little Shop. I just really like working together in a group on projects like this. I even enjoyed Bike Share for as tedious as it was. The only one I didn't like was Job Tracker but only because it took me forever to figure out.

What did you learn from your independent projects?

That I didn't know how to do a lot of the things I thought I had down pretty well.

What did you learn from your paired projects?

That being able to talk out loud to someone I am working through the same problem with is the best way for me to get through it.

## Community

What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?

The student run one about automation taking over jobs and replacing all the people and the consequences of that.

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?

Just little things like taking trash out, cleaning the dishes, and participating in my posse. At first, and this is something I am still working on, I was helping lower mod students out but after about a week or 2 my own workload became too overwhelming. I do want to help out more.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?

I would like to have something I think is good enough to put in the code fair.
